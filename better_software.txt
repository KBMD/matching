	Conclusions
We created an optimal and computationally efficient algorithm to derive a matched case-control sample with and without replacement of controls. The code and the functions are publicly available as an open source in an R package.

	warning: Below we match one record from the majority group to each record in the minority group. This is done with replacement, meaning a single majority record can be matched to multiple minority records.

Lots of good explanatory information:
